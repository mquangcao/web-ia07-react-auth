# Assignment: React Authentication with JWT (Access + Refresh)

## Overview

Build a React single-page application that implements secure authentication using JWT access tokens and refresh tokens. The app should use Axios for HTTP requests, React Query for managing server state, and React Hook Form for handling form input and validation. You will design a complete client-side authentication flow that includes login, token storage, token refresh, logout, and public hosting.

## Objectives

- Understand and differentiate access tokens and refresh tokens.
- Configure Axios to attach access tokens and refresh them when expired.
- Use React Query to manage authentication and data fetching.
- Use React Hook Form for login and form input validation.
- Implement protected routes that require valid authentication.
- Handle logout and token invalidation correctly.
- Host the finished application on a public hosting platform.

## Requirements

### Authentication Flow
- The system must include a login and logout mechanism.
- Upon successful login, the server will return an access token and refresh token.
- The access token should be used for all authorized API requests.
- When the access token expires, the refresh token must be used to obtain a new one automatically.

### Token Management
- The access token should be stored in memory during the session.
- The refresh token should be stored in persistent storage (e.g., localStorage).
- On logout, all tokens must be cleared.

### Axios Configuration
- Create an Axios instance for API communication.
- Attach the access token to every request’s Authorization header.
- Handle 401 Unauthorized responses by refreshing the access token using the refresh token.
- If the refresh fails (e.g., expired refresh token), log the user out and redirect to the login page.

### React Query Integration
- Use React Query to manage API calls and authentication mutations.
- Use `useMutation` for login and logout actions.
- Use `useQuery` for fetching user data from protected endpoints.
- Invalidate or refetch queries as needed when the authentication state changes.

### React Hook Form Integration
- Use React Hook Form to manage the login form.
- Validate user input fields such as email and password before submission.
- Display error messages for missing or invalid input.
- Integrate form submission with the login mutation from React Query.

### Protected Routes
- Implement protected routes that only allow access if a valid access token exists.
- Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

### User Interface
- Create a login page with email and password fields managed by React Hook Form.
- Display user information on a protected dashboard after successful login.
- Include a logout button that clears tokens and redirects to the login page.

### Public Hosting
- Deploy the application to a public hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Firebase Hosting).
- Ensure that all protected routes and API calls function correctly in the hosted version.
- Provide the public URL in the README file.

### Error Handling
- Display meaningful error messages for failed login, expired tokens, or network issues.
- Handle refresh token expiration gracefully by logging out automatically.

## Deliverables
- A React application implementing the described authentication flow.
- The app hosted publicly and accessible via a shared URL.
- A short README file describing how to set up, run, and access the project.
- Optional: Include a simple backend or mock API to simulate the login, refresh, and protected data endpoints.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Authentication logic and correctness** (30%)
  - Access and refresh token handling is implemented correctly.
- **Axios interceptor setup** (20%)
  - Proper request and response interception with automatic token refresh.
- **React Query integration** (15%)
  - Authentication and data fetching use React Query appropriately.
- **React Hook Form integration** (10%)
  - Login form is implemented using React Hook Form with proper validation.
- **Public hosting and deployment** (10%)
  - Application is deployed and accessible on a public hosting platform.
- **UI and UX** (10%)
  - Functional and clear user interface for login, logout, and dashboard.
- **Error handling and code organization** (5%)
  - Robust error management and clean, modular code structure.

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Implement silent token refresh before expiration.
- Use cookies for refresh token storage instead of localStorage.
- Add support for multi-tab synchronization (logout reflects across tabs).
- Include role-based access control for specific routes.

## Goal
Demonstrate a secure, maintainable, and deployable pattern for JWT-based authentication in React applications using Axios, React Query, and React Hook Form.
